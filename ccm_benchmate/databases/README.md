Currently this is empty, the goal is to gather information and requests from the general community to 
create either a standalone database with a query schema or just a collection of read-only file where 
users can search for their data on their own. Once this is done we will also release the files and their 
respective contents available here that are under hpc. Additionally we will provide a download script to 
create the same folder/database structure as well as instructions to how to regularly update the files 
as new versions of databases become available.
