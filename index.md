# CCM Benchmate

**CCM Benchmate** is an open-source toolkit for integrating and analyzing biological data from diverse 
public resources, literature, and your own research. Designed for bioinformaticians and computational 
biologists, it offers modular, interoperable components to build data pipelines and accelerate 
discovery.

**üõ†Ô∏è To get started, please see the [installation 
instructions](https://github.com/ccmbioinfo/ccm_benchmate/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md).** 
Each module is independently usable and well-documented‚Äîcheck out the README in each module's folder for 
details and code examples.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Unified APIs**: Access major bioinformatics databases (UniProt, NCBI, Ensembl, STRINGdb, and more) 
through a simple Python interface.
- **Literature Search & Processing**: Find, download, and extract content from scientific articles 
(PubMed, arXiv, OpenAlex), with tools for processing PDFs and full-text mining.
- **Container Integration**: Seamlessly run and manage Singularity/Apptainer containers locally or on 
HPC, with tools to convert and deploy your own environments.
- **Genome, Sequence, and Variant Handling**: Intuitive classes for genomic intervals, sequences, 
variants, and annotations.
- **Structure Support**: Import, analyze, or predict molecular structures using state-of-the-art models.
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Store and query your processed data and analysis results using PostgreSQL + 
pgvector for advanced semantic search (coming soon).

‚≠êÔ∏è Work in progress! Not yet intended for production. Feedback and 
[contributions](https://github.com/ccmbioinfo/ccm_benchmate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome.

## üí¨ Documentation

Comprehensive documentation‚Äîincluding module guides and usage examples‚Äîis available at README.md under

## üí° Roadmap

Our key development goals include:  

- **Knowledge Base:** Build a flexible, queryable database for integrated results and literature.  
- **Container Library:** Provide ready-to-use containers for common bioinformatics tasks.  
- **Expanded APIs & Databases:** Add support for more biological data resources with unified querying.  
- **Enhanced Models:** Integrate advanced models for sequence, structure, and variant analyses.  
- **Documentation & Testing:** Improve user guides, examples, and increase test coverage.  
- **Community Contributions:** Encourage feedback, examples, and additional containers from users.

We welcome contributions to help accelerate these efforts. For details, please see
