## ROADMAP

There are several avenues that we are currently exploring to expand the functionality of this package. 
Below is a list of the most important ones:

+ **Knowledge Base**: We are working on a knowledge base module that will allow you to store the results 
of your searches and queries in a database. 
This will allow you to query the data later and generate hypotheses to test and analyze. The goal is to 
provide a way to store the data that you have retrieved from the different modules in a structured way 
that allows you to query it later.
+ **Container Library**: We are working on a library of containers that can be used to process your 
data. These will be available in our own docker container registry and can be used to create 
singularity/apptainer containers.
+ **More APIs**: We are working on adding more APIs to the package. We are also trying to figure out a 
more streamlined way to combine the results of different api calls in to a more unified data structure. 
This would allow your 
queries to be scripted more easily. 
+ **More Models**: We are working on adding more models to the package. We are hoping to integrate the 
state of the art models for sequence, structure and variant analyses. 
+ **More Databases**: We are working on adding more databases to the package. We are then hoping to 
provide a way to query these databases in a unified way. These will be locally stored databases that do 
not require api calls.
+ **More Documentation**: We are working on adding more documentation to the package. Once we have a 
more functional package we will create a deatailed documentation for each module and how they can be 
used together both interactively and in a pipeline.
+ **More Tests**: We are working on adding more tests to the package. This is an urgent requirement that 
we could use help with. If you have experience using `pytest` and would like to help us write tests 
please create a pull request. 
+ **More Examples**: We are working on adding more examples to the package. If you have suggestions for 
examples that you would like to see please create an issue on the GitHub repository and we will try to 
add them.
+ **More Containers**: We are working on adding more containers to the package. Once we have a series of 
containers that can be used to process your data will create instructions as to how to pull them and use 
them as either Docker or Singularity/Apptainer containers.
